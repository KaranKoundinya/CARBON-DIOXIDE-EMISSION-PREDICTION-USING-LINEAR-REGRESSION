# CARBON-DIOXIDE-EMISSION-PREDICTION-USING-LINEAR-REGRESSION

In the current research landscape, power of data to make a sizeable contribution to prediction 
algorithms is huge.We can use prediction algorithms like Linear regression in business to 
evaluate trends and to make forecasts/estimates, for example if the sales in a company have 
increased exponentially for the last two years, we can conduct linear analysis on the monthly 
sales data and predict the sales in the future years.For this i have considered a 
dataset which provides the model specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon and 
the estimated for new light duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada in 2022

Using the above-mentioned dataset, i have used the model to predict the CO2 emissions(tailpipe), 
in grams per kilometre which is a combination of two parameters(city and highway) as present 
in the dataset, i have picked this particular dataset as it is tackling an issue which is extremely 
vital for the environment and for vehicle manufactures as it highlights the carbon dioxide 
emission, this model can aid the vehicle manufactures in picking out certain vehicles which can 
cause more damage to the environment through the predicted carbon dioxide emissions for the 
vehicles under consideration. I have also created certain key performance indicators 
which aid in comparing different aspects of the data under consideration which in turns enables 
the vehicle manufacturers to understand the performance of their products which would then 
enhance their future business decisions with respect to their products
